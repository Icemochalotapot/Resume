    <h2>Sumary 
        <p>After rehoning my skills as an IT professional with the CompTIA A+ certification just over a year ago; I have
        been striving to gain as much hands-on experience as I can, both on and off the job. I would like to find a
        company to learn and build with for the long-term. I believe two of the biggest, non technical, assets I would
        bring are Loyalty and Dedication. My personal goal is to add to my certifications and continue learning and
        growing with my next role.
        </p>
